# Mini Max AI Algorithm

The key to the Minimax algorithm is a back and forth between the two players,
where the player whose "turn it is" desires to pick the move with the maximum
score. In turn, the scores for each of the available moves are determined by the
opposing player deciding which of its available moves has the minimum score.
And the scores for the opposing players moves are again determined by the
turn-taking player trying to maximize its score and so on all the way down the
move tree to an end state.
A description for the algorithm, assuming X is the "turn taking player," would
look something like:

•If the game is over, return the score from X's perspective.

•Otherwise get a list of new game states for every possible move

•Create a scores list

•For each of these states add the minimax result of that state to the
scores list

•If it's X's turn, return the maximum score from the scores list

•If it's O's turn, return the minimum score from the scores list

We'll notice that this algorithm is recursive, it flips back and forth between the
players until a final score is found.
